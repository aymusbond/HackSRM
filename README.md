Planning to make a "LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR".
It will take input as speech and convert it into text.
The text will be converted into preferable language.

update 6:00:
We are done with speech recogination and converting into text.
Now we are working on translation.

update 7:00:
We are able to successfully convert any piece of digital text into speech. 
This is expected to help out blind/visually impaired people.

update 9:15:
We are able to convert a text from english to more than 50 global languages.
Now, we are trying to convert these outputs to their respective speech.
