Planning to make a "LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR".
It will take input as speech and convert it into text.
The text will be converted into preferable language.


update 6:00:
We are done with speech recogination and converting into text.
Now we are working on translation.

update 7:00:
We are able to successfully convert any piece of digital text into speech. 
This is expected to help out blind/visually impaired people.

update 9:15:
We are able to convert a text from english to more indian and global languages.
Now, we are trying to convert these outputs to their respective speech.

update 11:10:
Able to convert an image to text using tesseract.
Able to speak out text.
Going to integrate all the above functions into an app or website.

update 1:15:
The program is able to speak out the text from any format of image in one go.We are doing in a way that, it is scanning a text and giving the output by reading it. It means it is working as a book reader and even more than that.
Going to integrate all the above functions into an app or website.

update 4:20:
Finally we come up with an idea which can scan any text image of any language and will convert it into any text of any language which you are preferable in.
The next step of ours is to connect our phone cam with the code and convert the translated text into voice. 

update 5:55 am:
Finally we succeed in getting the voice message of all the text in all the prefferable languages . 
Trying to integrate web cam to convert image text into picture extension files.

update 7:05 am:
Done with the ppt presentation and the hack is also almost ready. Just to implement the web cam to the code. Trying to make it more advanced adding more features to it. 

update 10:48 am:
We are done with the whole part of the coding including the transformation of text captured by webcam into an audio file with yours language preference.
Steps that our program does:
1)It takes text as image captured directly from webcam.
2)It then recognizes the image and convert it into digital text.
3)The digital text is converted it into your prefered language and will read aloud for you.
along with this, our presentation is ready and also if time permits us, we are trying to add more and more features to it.
